EasyPass - A Memorable Yet Secure Password Generator

Project Idea

EasyPass is a lightweight program designed to simplify the process of creating strong and memorable passwords. It combines memorable names from a document with assorted special characters and numbers to strike a balance between security and ease of use.

Goals

Balancing Security and Usability: Most "secure" password generators tend to create complex and hard-to-remember passwords. However, for the average person who isn't necessarily a high-value target, these overly complex passwords can be more of a hassle than a benefit. EasyPass aims to provide a solution that is both secure and user-friendly.

Key Objectives: Memorability: EasyPass generates passwords that are based on memorable names from a list that I have compiled. This ensures that the resulting passwords are more familiar and easier to remember for users.

Enhanced Security: To prevent brute force account breaches, the program augments the selected words with assorted special characters and numbers, increasing password complexity.

Educational Component: EasyPass includes educational resources within the program to guide users on password security best practices. It encourages the use of unique passwords for each account and provides tips on securely storing passwords.

Privacy and Security Assurance: The program is designed with user privacy and security in mind. It does not compromise user data. NO PASSWORDS ARE SAVED AFTER GENERATION. By striking the right balance between security and ease of use, EasyPass aims to provide an effective and user-friendly solution for generating secure passwords in an era where online security is paramount.

AMOUNT OF POSSIBLE PASSWORDS:
Since there are three hundred and eighteen names on the list, and we use two names per password, one special character, and three random numbers, the total number of possible passwords that can be created are 14,441,800,000. We can easily double or triple this number by just adding more names to the list, although for the purposes of this project, I believe this suffices.
